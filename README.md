# MovieKotlin
MovieKotlin is a sample Android application that uses the clean architecture approach and is written in Kotlin.

### The Motivation behind the app: ###
During the work on this app, I want to learn about, Some of those subjects include:
- The Kotlin programming language
- Clean architecture
- Dagger2
- Android architecture components (ViewModels, LiveData, Room, etc.)

### How to run the app: ###
This app uses [The MovieDB public API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
Register (its free) and grab your API key, 
then paste it inside: `.../res/values/api_key.xml`
